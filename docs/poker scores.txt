Here is a set of hand rankings that is almost universally accepted to determine the winner of a hand of poker. Listed below from strongest to weakest.

Hand	Description
5 of a Kind		Five cards of any one rank, when playing with wild cards.
Royal Flush		The best possible straight flush. Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace all of the same suit.
Straight Flush		Cards of five consecutive ranks, all of the same suit
4 of a Kind		Four cards of any one rank, and any other card
Full House		Three cards of one rank, and two cards of a second rank.
Flush			Five cards of the same suit that doesn't make a straight
Straight		Cards of five consecutive ranks when not all five are of the same suit
Three of a Kind		Three cards of the same rank and two unrelated cards
Two Pair		Two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank, and a fifth
One Pair		Two cards of the same rank and three other unrelated cards
High Card		Known as a 'Busted Hand'. Five unrelated cards – no pair, no flush, no straight. Nothing.
In the event of a tie, the player with the highest hand is determined by the value of the cards.
